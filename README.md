# Inv_Admissions
Predictive modeling of involuntary psychiatric admissions before and during COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary psychiatric hospital in Romania. Data analysis, logistic regression, and risk factor identification.
## Overview
This repository contains data and scripts related to a retrospective study aimed at identifying and predicting risk factors for involuntary psychiatric admissions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data originate from a tertiary psychiatric hospital in Sibiu, Romania.

## Objectives
- To analyze how COVID-19 impacted involuntary psychiatric admissions.
- To identify key socio-demographic, clinical, behavioral, and procedural risk factors.
- To develop and validate a predictive logistic regression model (including bias reduction via Firth logistic regression).

## Repository Contents

- **data/**: Raw and processed datasets used for analysis.
- **scripts/**: SAS scripts and analyses.
- **results/**: Output results, tables, figures, and logistic regression outputs.
- **documentation/**: Detailed methods, variable descriptions, and supplementary material.

## Methods
- Chi-square, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests, and logistic regression modeling (including Firth logistic regression for bias reduction) conducted in SAS Studio.
